# Tulip : Tuition Management System

## Project Requirements:
1. Creation of Students, Teachers, and assignments should be supported from the Django admin site to create update, and delete.
2. Create an API that can Get a JWT token when a valid username and password are present.
3. Create an API GET student details :
(Note: Based on token if the user is a student)

## Methodology:
1. Created custom user for whom roles can be assigned.
2. Here is roles map:
        ```
        {
            "student":1,
            "teacher":2,
            "admin":3  # unused as of now
        }
        ```
3. created custom permissions to check the user roles. permissions.py file in tulip_api_app.
4. Configured authetication for DRF
5. Created Models for Subjects , Teachers, Students.
6. Created Required Views and added configurations.
7. Did a lot of googling ðŸ˜„.

I am sure i have missed a lot of steps in Methodology.
